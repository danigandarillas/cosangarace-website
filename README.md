Paper Kit 2 Angular is a free Bootstrap 4 UI Kit with pale colors, beautiful typography built for Angular 7.

All components are fully responsive and look great on every screen size. Transitions, shadows, colors, they all resemble the flow you would have using pieces of paper.

We have created Paper UI Kit kit having pastel colors and paper in mind. It feels light, fresh and easy to go through.

Paper Kit 2 Angular is using Ng Bootstrap (https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home), as core framework.
